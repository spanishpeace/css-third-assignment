       <p>I will dearly miss steve jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones i<br> have loved them ever since the first one.
         Steve jobs was a great man and a<br> awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day and go for and<br> work with the apple when i get old
         but my dream is to own Apple and follow<br> by Steve jobs way and make Apple greater than before it was. But i will<br> dearly miss Steve Jobs he's a great man and i will never forget him.

        <p>As i heard this sad news via my iphone i am emailing my condolences from<br> my MacBook Pro. Steve has left a fingerprint on our culture
        that cannot be<br> rivaled and will be long lasting. My deepest sympathy to his family and<br> friends.

        <h5>Steve jobs</h5>
        <p>What impact has steve jobs had on my life? Every short story i've written<br> as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every<br>
        email i've ever written, has been written on machines created by Apple. I<br> interacted online using an Apple machine long before i ever encountered a<br> PC, Steve Jobs helped to realize the 
        Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid.<br> And through his vision, i have been able to realize my own. You'll be<br> missed, Mr jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.

        <h5>He's gone...</h5>
        <p>A part of my heart has cracked. I didn't know him personally but i felt like i<br> know him. I will forever remember him. i'm still saddened because he was<br> taken too soon.
        I can only imagine hes struggles. Heaven has certainly<br> gained an angel.

        <br>
        <p>Dear Steve's family, dear Apple company i cant't find words how to describe<br> my feelings... For me Apple means a lot-I got 
           a good job using Apple<br> products, I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple. And of course, i've<br> been always admiring your products.
           And for me everything in Apple is<br> connected with Steve. I do hope he'll be remembered around the world as a<br> genius.
